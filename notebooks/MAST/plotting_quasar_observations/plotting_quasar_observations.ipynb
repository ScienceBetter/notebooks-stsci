    "Quasars are extremely luminous astronomical objects that can be found at the center of some galaxies. They are powered by gas spiraling at high velocity into a super-massive black hole. The brightest quasars are capable of outshining all the stars in their galaxy, they can be seen from billions of light-years away. The first quasar ever discovered is called **3c273**, it is one of the most luminous quasars and therefore one of the most luminous objects in the observable universe. It is at a distance of 749 Megaparsecs [1 Megaparsec = 1 million parsecs = 3.26 million lightyears] with an absolute magnitude of âˆ’26.7, meaning that if it were at a distance of 10 parsecs, it would be as bright in our sky as the Sun. <br>\n",
    "    \n",
    "Quasar **3c273** is the target we will focus on in this tutorial. We will first gather all the observations of this quasar from the MAST archive. Then, we will plot those observations as a function of wavelength versus time. Finally, we will plot a spectrum from one of the observations. These two plots should help us to understand what the history of this quasar looks and then we can try to draw our own conclusions."
