    "This tutorial teaches us to align images between HST observations using `drizzlepac` and `tweakreg`. We learn the subtleties of combining images from different filters in a single visit, and combining multiple visits. Image aligning and stacking is crucial to make the most of the extensive Hubble archives, and are a crucial tool in preparing proposals for future observations. \n",
