    "- Determine if a stellar system in the APOGEE catalog has lightcurve in the TESS Data for Asteroseismology Lightcurves archive from TASOC (the TESS Asterosesmic Science Operations Center).\n",
    "- If so, plot the lightcurve using `lightkurve`.\n",
    "- (Maybe?) Given a known eclipsing cadence, predict future eclipsing event dates/times for follow up observations.\n",
    "- (Not this tutorial, likely a second one, but putting the idea here for future refrence) Cross-reference two catalogs to find objects that appear in both. "
