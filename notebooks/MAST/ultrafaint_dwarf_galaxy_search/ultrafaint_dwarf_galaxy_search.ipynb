    "\n",
    "Ultra-faint dwarf (UFD) galaxies are a subset of dwarf galaxies that are classified by having one hundred thousand to a few hundred thousand stars, making them the faintest galaxies in the universe. They differ from globular clusters in that they have a significant amount of dark matter which extends beyond the visible stellar matter. Because of their high concentration of dark matter, astronomers believe there could be unique insights into the early universe in UFD's. All UFD's that have been discovered are ancient systems that are believed to have formed only a few million years after the Big Bang.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The target we will focus on in this tutorial is Pegasus V whose discovery was recently published in the paper \"Pegasus V -- a newly discovered ultra-faint dwarf galaxy on the outskirts of Andromeda\" by Collins et al. 2022. \n"
